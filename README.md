### Hi there üëãüèº
I'm Chris, a full-stack data scientist. Currently, I'm working on AI at [Klaviyo](https://github.com/murphycw/)
I love learning new things, and then translating those insights into results.
In my spare time I like to ride my bicycle.

### Media Interviews üí¨
In addition to the below interviews, I have also been invited to give dozens of scientific presentations at conferences and universities in seven different countries.
- Klaviyo Data Science Podcast [What Real Data Scientists Wish They'd Known Earlier in their Careers](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/klaviyo-data-science/episodes/Klaviyo-Data-Science-Podcast-EP-49--What-Real-Data-Scientists-Wish-Theyd-Known-Earlier-in-their-Careers-e2m61th/a-abejhmj)
- Forbes: [Deploying Models In An Evolving Housing Market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aparnadhinakaran/2022/06/22/deploying-models-in-an-evolving-housing-market/?sh=1b66c9f9684f) 
- The Data Standard: [Balancing short term and long term successes](https://datastandard.io/podcast/the-data-standard-audio-experience-with-chris-murphy-from-homepoint/)

### Research üß≤
Prior to tech, I worked academia, which included living in Pisa, Italy for two yearsa. 
My research was in the field of theoretical high energy physics.
Primarily, I investigated the then newly discovered Higgs boson, and analyzed experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider in a model-independent fashion to search for signs of physics beyond the Standard Model using effective field theory techniques.
The most recent (last?) [research presentation](https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/13632/contributions/24626/) I gave was fittingly at the Higgs and Effective Field Theory conference back in 2021.
All of my fundamental physics publications are available for free on [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=ea%20c.w.murphy.1%20and%20not%20collaboration%20belle%20ii%20and%20not%20primarch%20physics.acc-ph%20and%20not%20primarch%20physics.ins-det%20and%20not%20texkey%20Weikum%3A2019ubf&ui-citation-summary=true).
Note that as Chris Murphy is such a common name, I recommend using INSPIRE over [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QZW7r6IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).
