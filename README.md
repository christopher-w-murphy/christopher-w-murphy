### Research ðŸ§²
Prior to tech, I worked academia. 
My research was in the field of theoretical high energy physics.
In particular, I investigated the then newly discovered Higgs boson and analyzed experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider in a model-independent fashion to search for signs of physics beyond the Standard Model.
The most recent [research presentation](https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/13632/contributions/24626/) I gave was at the Higgs and Effective Field Theory conference back in 2021.
All of my high energy theory publications are available for free on [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=ea%20c.w.murphy.1%20and%20not%20collaboration%20belle%20ii%20and%20not%20primarch%20physics.acc-ph%20and%20not%20primarch%20physics.ins-det%20and%20not%20texkey%20Weikum%3A2019ubf&ui-citation-summary=true).
Note that as Chris Murphy is such a common name, I recommend using INSPIRE over [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QZW7r6IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).
